# Seattle Coffeeshops!

a list of study spots I enjoy in Seattle and also a side quest to learn React + Remix



### Feature backlog
* Fix background home image resizing (scale by height not width + min-width)
* Add mobile compatibility via media queries
* Add yelp links?
* Add location-based filtering (search bar currently filters by city, but does not visually indicate cities from scrollbar)
* Remix-ify image hosting + API retries to improve latency
* Fix bug where chrome extensions attempt to load an additional `styles.css` stylesheet
